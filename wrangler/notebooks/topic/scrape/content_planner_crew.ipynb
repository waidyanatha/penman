One of the primary advantages of CAP-based early warning systems is their potential to save lives by providing crucial time for people to act or evacuate in potentially life-threatening situations.\\n\\nBy adopting CAP, countries can effectively strengthen their disaster response capabilities aligning with the four pillars of the Early Warning for All Initiative: disaster risk knowledge, monitoring, analysis and forecasting of hazards, alert systems, and preparedness actions. The increasing global trend in CAP adoption underlines the rising need for enhanced, unified, and adaptive early warning solutions.\\n\\nTo generate an elaborate technical report, this research content can be further subdivided into several sections and paragraphs, including technical aspects, comparisons to any other relevant alerting protocols, and country-specific CAP implementations.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n* duckduckgo.com: DuckDuckGo Search results for 'Real-life Common Alerting Protocol early warning systems examples'.\\n\\nBegin!

CAP, part of the EDXL suite of standards, provides an open, non-proprietary message format for delivering all-hazard alerts and notifications. Over the past two decades, CAP has become a model of global collaboration and a fundamental component of emergency communications systems worldwide. Its use across multiple platforms has helped save countless lives through timely, reliable messaging. Today, 87% of the world’s population lives in a country with at least one national-level CAP news feed for emergency notifications.\\xa0\\nCAP enables a consistent message to be disseminated simultaneously over a variety of communication pathways, including radio, television, mobile phones, emails, and other media. This all-hazards, all-media format ensures that critical alerts (e.g., weather events, earthquakes, tsunami, volcanoes, public health crises, power outages, fires, child abductions, and more) reach the public swiftly and efficiently, regardless of the medium.\\n“As we celebrate 20 years of CAP, I’m incredibly proud that it has become the backbone of emergency communication worldwide, recognized by the UN as the standard for the Early Warnings for All program. The success of CAP is a testament to the dedication and collaboration of so many over the years, and I extend my sincere thanks to everyone who has played a part in making it the global standard it is today,” said Elysa Jones, chair of the OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee (EMTC). “CAP’s ability to deliver consistent, interoperable alerts through multiple channels has made it indispensable for disaster management. We’ll continue to evolve CAP to ensure it serves communities in need.”\\nThe CAP community will commemorate this significant anniversary milestone at the CAP Implementation Workshop from 22-24 October in Leuven, Belgium. OASIS is a co-sponsor of the event, which will focus on the use of CAP and its consistent use throughout the world. OASIS and the EMTC will continue to work with nations and organizations to explore future advancements in global emergency alerting.\\nThe fundamental need for CAP was identified by the Partnership for Public Warning (PPW) in response to the 9/11 attacks when there was no consistent method for informing the nation. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami highlighted the urgent need for improved emergency alert communication across the globe. With the support of Eliot Christian, longtime CAP advocate and former chief architect of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Information System (WIS), and Elysa Jones, chair of the OASIS EMTC, along with EMTC members, CAP was officially adopted by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 2007 as ITU-T Recommendation X.1303. Since then, many international organizations like the WMO, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) have embraced CAP as an essential standard for emergency alerting. In 2021, the Call to Action on Emergency Alerting set a goal to achieve 100% CAP implementation by 2025, an initiative that has since been integrated into the UN’s Early Warnings for All initiative.\\xa0\\nOASIS and its partners are committed to increasing global CAP adoption.

At the time of disasters, government agencies, first responders, as well as the general public, all require timely access to entrusted, understandable, relevant, and actionable information. The necessity of an efficient public alerting system has been advocated at various international forums from time to time. The study offers a multi-modal strategy that involves multi-stakeholders to bridge communication gaps; is multi-phased to be used in all phases of disaster management; targets multi-hazards; uses multi-technology including telecom, satellite, mobile, internet, and broadcasting technologies; supports multi-linguality to disseminate alerts in local regional languages; and offers targeted information in multi-media format for all citizens.

What an honour to celebrate the stellar achievements of the satellite industry here with you.Let me start by congratulating all the nominees of the Via Satellite Magazine Annual Awards, as well as those in the Startup Space 2024 competition. As Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union, I am so proud to be part of such an innovative and vibrant ecosystem.ITU is a United Nations (UN) agency that focuses on radiocommunication, standardization and digital development.Everything that makes global communication possible.We are also the only UN agency in which the private sector participates actively in its work. And I'm thrilled to share that, in addition to 193 Member States, we've just passed the milestone of a thousand Sector Members.Many of them include satellite operators, new space companies, from established firms, to start-ups, as well as regulatory bodies and space agencies.All these innovators contribute to ITU's mission to connect the world.That's a big part of why I'm so excited to be here today.Another reason is that I've been fascinated by space ever since I was little.I watched the Apollo missions in awe − and caught the tech bug early.Some of you may know my career began some 30 years ago as a US Government official in the Commerce Department.International satellite systems were part of my portfolio back then, when satellites were still largely the domain of governments.\\xa0 I remember well the efforts of PanAmSat in pushing for more competition, as well as the early filings of Iridium, Teledesic, and others.ITU's role in the space and satellite industry stretches back even further. We began allocating radio frequencies for space activities 60 years ago – not long after Sputnik-1 was launched in 1957.Even part of the Moon is protected from radio-frequency interference − thanks to a visionary ITU decision taken in 1971.It probably sounded like something out of sci-fi at the time.And yet, five decades and 77 successful lunar missions later, the ITU-maintained Radio Regulations continue to safeguard that lunar zone: for radioastronomy; for critical space research; and for humanity's return to the Moon that is just on the horizon.Still, the satellite industry has changed so much since those Sputnik days.Space is more accessible than ever — no longer dominated by government agencies alone.Hundreds of private companies are developing space projects.Operators from 91 countries have put satellites in orbit in just two decades, propelling them from niche applications to critical global infrastructure – especially for broadband connectivity.There are now a whopping 7 billion satellite-enabled smartphones in use around the world.And as devastating climate disasters become more frequent, satellites are contributing to UN initiatives like Early Warnings for All, which aims to protect everyone on Earth with an early warning system by 2027.I'm proud that ITU leads the Communication and Dissemination pillar of this initiative, which involves making sure those alerts and warnings reach everyone, especially those communities most at risk. Our Common Alerting Protocol enables us to scale the dissemination of warnings through multiple communication channels, including satellite direct broadcast.And of course, satellites are key in the detection, monitoring, analysis and forecasting of hazards.In fact, at least 40 per cent of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals rely on: Earth observation, remote sensing, and global navigation satellite systems.I've just returned from the G7 meeting in Italy last week, where Digital Ministers also recognized the vital importance of satellite constellations, highlighting their ability to advance ecosystem resilience while providing essential services, including global, uninterrupted broadband connectivity. Now, with all these opportunities comes a great deal of complexity − and no shortage of challenges.Chief among them is the long-term sustainability of spectrum and orbital resources, which require careful coordination and management for this industry and the entire global economy to function.And that's exactly where ITU comes in.The entire space ecosystem is underpinned by ITU standards and regulations. We're responsible for coordinating radio frequency spectrum on Earth and in space, and we help coordinate positions in the geostationary orbit.This is done through an international treaty that ultimately secures your investments, by seeking to prevent \\xa0− and eliminate − harmful interference between radio systems.The outcomes of our World Radiocommunication Conference — held just three months ago in Dubai — directly, and I think positively impact how satellite business is conducted globally.Key WRC-23 decisions include: the allocation of more spectrum to space services; additional protections for space research and Earth exploration; a more stable and transparent regulatory framework for space services; and forward-looking studies that include inter-satellite links, low-orbiting constellations, lunar communications and other novel applications.And just before WRC-23, the Radiocommunication Assembly adopted a specific resolution on ITU's role in space sustainability.We've already begun to collect disposal strategies and methodologies for non-geostationary satellites, and have set up a dedicated portal to ensure best practices are shared widely.Satellite operators, manufacturers, launch providers and other space stakeholders are all encouraged to share their deorbit strategies and plans with ITU so that they can be considered in our study groups. World Radiocommunication Conference delegates also agreed on the agenda for 2027, which I'm excited to tell you is more than 80 per cent space-related.It includes a visionary new agenda item that will help establish the first generation of lunar communications, and another that will pave the way for the direct-to-device market.It just goes to show that international cooperation on space communications is more important than ever, whether for multinational or commercial missions.And ITU is where it's happening every single day.Ladies and gentlemen, The space economy is now worth hundreds of billions of dollars — thanks in part to your incredible ingenuity, adaptability, and resilience.But as this industry advances at the speed of light, digital inclusion is inching forward at a snail's pace.Even with thousands of satellites orbiting overhead, 2.6 billion people are still unconnected. The digital divide remains one of the biggest challenges of our time.It's right up there with climate change and environmental sustainability. But I'm optimistic, because I know that there's so much this industry has to offer. Together, we can make our shared space environment more sustainable — while connecting the third of humanity that remains offline.That's why I'm calling on the satellite industry to join the Partner2Connect Digital Coalition.This is a groundbreaking, multi-stakeholder, ITU-led initiative to reach the hardest-to-connect places in the world — in this decisive decade.So far, we've mobilized USD 6 billion.And at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, USD 9 billion worth of commitments from the mobile industry brought us nearly halfway to our target of USD 100 billion in pledges by 2026.But we can't reach that ambitious goal without you.Sometimes, satellite broadband is the only option to get these rural and remote communities online.ITU is the satellite industry's UN partner. We're here to support our members: with frequency management; capacity-building; technical studies and standards − that are defining the future of space communications.I hope you'll join us in our mission to connect the unconnected, to: bring the benefits of digital transformation to everyone, and to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals.Because not even the sky is the limit to what we can achieve together.Thank you.\\u200b\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.itu.int/en/osg/Pages/Speeches.aspx?ItemID=39', 'title': \"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n     Secretary-General's Corner:

AL HASSAN, TSAG Chair,Vice Chairs of TSAG,Fellow Elected Officials,Seizo Onoe, Director of the TSB,Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,\\xa0 We meet during interesting times. Times where artificial intelligence is at everyone\\'s lips. At the same time, there are still 2.6 billion people that are still off-line. In the Development Sector, we are focusing on five key thematic topics that include affordable connectivity, enabling environment, digital transformation, resource mobilization and international cooperation, and finally inclusive and secure telecommunications/ICTs for sustainable development. For us to succeed, we need sound standards – resulting from your splendid work that ensures that devices and networks from different manufacturers can work together seamlessly. This is why we have provided a platform through the ITU Academy to allow the TSB to carry out training and strengthen skills development for countries especially developing countries to be able to apply ITU-T recommendations. \\u200bI would like to highlight that bridging the standardization gap between developed and developing continues to be the pinnacle of our joint efforts towards a more sustainable and equitable world. As mandated by the Plenipotentiary Conference in Resolution 123 and relevant WTDC and WTSA resolutions we need to work together “to ensure that we enhance the ability of all countries, in particular the developing countries, to draft, access, implement and influence ITU-T recommendations\" to “ensure universal connectivity and sustainable digital transformation.\"I am pleased that ITU-T and ITU-D are already working closely together. Let me give you some examples of our joint work and the impact we are making together.Based on the work of ITU-T, we have been able to save lives by strengthening early warning systems and ensuring harmonized alerting messages reach those at risk. Standards and recommendations, such as the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), for which BDT provides training to our Member States, have been implemented in 133 countries and have reached 82% of the world\\'s population.Our joint work on digital transformation of government services is appreciated by membership. One of the BDT initiatives in this regard – GovStack – is a leap forward in this direction. In cybersecurity, beyond setting standards you have also shaped robust strategies and policies for global cybersecurity resilience. We are proud of our joint key initiatives which include establishing National CIRTs, conducting regular CyberDrills, and developing National Cybersecurity Strategies and Action Plans.Finally, through your work on standards, you have helped to reinforce digital inclusion. By mainstreaming digital accessibility and online safety requirements we have ensured that the benefits of technological advancement are shared broadly across society without any discrimination in a barrier-free digital environment. \\u200bWe also cooperate in the work of our Study Groups. You will be pleased to note that ITU-D\\'s Study Group 2, Question 4/2 on “conformance and interoperability (C&I) programmes,\" from the previous study period continues to be discussed today. I invite you to browse the ITU-D Study Group web pages to familiarize yourselves with the progress of these discussions.\\xa0 Additionally, through the ITU-D Study Groups and their existing mechanisms, such as liaison statements and workshops, we facilitate each other\\'s work. The capacity building workshop on the Future of TV, organised jointly by Study Groups from all three sectors, in Bogotá and Bangalore last year, is a case in point. I want to wish you great preparations for WTSA-24. As we will hold our World Telecommunication Development Conference in 2025, we look forward to applying good, efficient working methods and organizational aspects drawn from WTSA. We hope to join hands in streamlining resolutions to avoid duplications.\\xa0 Thank you for your attention.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/bdt-director/Pages/Speeches.aspx?ItemID=516', 'title': \"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    BDT Director's Corner: Speeches\\r\\n\\r\\n\", 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Page Content 2\\n\\nPage Content 3\\n\\n\\nPage Content 4\\n\\nPage Content 5\\n\\n\\nPage Content 17\\n\\nPage Content 16\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nPage Content 9\\n\\nPage Content 10\\n\\n \\nPage Content 18\\n\\n\\n \\nPage Content 19\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nLatest Speeches\\n\\nPage Content 11\\u200b\\u200b\\xa0\\u200b'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/bdt-director/Pages/Speeches.aspx?ItemID=516', 'title': \"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    BDT Director's Corner: Speeches\\r\\n\\r\\n\", 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Council Working Group on Child Online Protection (CWG COP), Welcome Remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Geneva, Switzerland,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa030 September 2024Annual meetings of the Expert Groups on Telecommunication/ICT Indicators (EGTI) and on Household Telecommunication/ICT Indicators (EGH) 2024, Opening remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Geneva, Switzerland,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa025 September 2024World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Symposium 2024, Opening remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Geneva, Switzerland,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa023 September 2024ITU Digital Skills Forum, Opening Remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Manama, Bahrain,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa017 September 2024ITU Academy Training Centres  Global Annual Meeting, Opening Remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Manama, Bahrain,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa016 September 2024Early Warning for All Initiative (Pillar 3) Webinar for Africa Region, Opening Remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Virtual,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa012 September 2024UN Committee on the Rights of the Child Meeting, ‘Artificial Intelligence and Child Rights’, Opening Remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Geneva, Switzerland,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa006 September 2024Meeting of the Telecommunication Standardization Advisory Group (TSAG),\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Geneva, Switzerland,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa029 July 2024First APT Meeting for the World Telecommunications Development Conference  (WTDC-25), Opening Remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Chiang Mai, Thailand,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa019 July 2024Giga Connectivity Forum, Remarks,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa0Geneva, Switzerland,\\r\\n   \\t\\t\\t\\xa009 July 2024'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/bdt-director/Pages/Speeches.aspx?ItemID=516', 'title': \"\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n    BDT Director's Corner: Speeches\\r\\n\\r\\n\", 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Page Content 12\\n\\n\\n Page Content 13\\n\\n\\nPage Content 15\\n\\nPage Content 6\\n\\n\\nPage Content 7\\n\\n\\n Page Content 8\\n\\n\\nPage Content 14\\n\\nFollow us\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nFlickr\\nLinkedin\\nInstagram\\nSoundcloud\\nPodcasts\\nSpotify\\nSpreaker\\nTikTok\\n\\n\\n© ITU  All Rights Reserved\\n\\nContact us\\nTerms of Use \\nPrivacy notice \\nAccessibility\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\nBack to top'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.preventionweb.net/media/86221/download?startDownload=20240716', 'title': '[file] Flyer (86221)', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='[file] Flyer (86221)\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Document downloadYour download will begin automatically.If the download does not begin, please click here to download directly.This website is operated by'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.einpresswire.com/article/749114366/oasis-celebrates-20th-anniversary-of-common-alerting-protocol-global-standard-for-alerts-and-warnings', 'title': '\\n  OASIS Celebrates 20th Anniversary of Common Alerting Protocol, Global Standard for Alerts and Warnings\\n  \\n', 'description': 'CAP Standard Has Transformed Emergency Communication and Continues to Save Lives ', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='OASIS Celebrates 20th Anniversary of Common Alerting Protocol, Global Standard for Alerts and Warnings\\n  \\n\\n\\n          About\\n        \\n\\n            About EIN Presswire\\n          \\n\\n            How We Are Different.

page_content=\"CAP Standard Has Transformed Emergency Communication and Continues to Save Lives \\nBOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, October 7, 2024 /EINPresswire.com/ -- This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) being established as an OASIS Open Standard. CAP, part of the EDXL suite of standards, provides an open, non-proprietary message format for delivering all-hazard alerts and notifications. Over the past two decades, CAP has become a model of global collaboration and a fundamental component of emergency communications systems worldwide. Its use across multiple platforms has helped save countless lives through timely, reliable messaging. Today, 87% of the world's population lives in a country with at least one national-level CAP news feed for emergency notifications. \\nCAP enables a consistent message to be disseminated simultaneously over a variety of communication pathways, including radio, television, mobile phones, emails, and other media. This all-hazards, all-media format ensures that critical alerts (e.g., weather events, earthquakes, tsunami, volcanoes, public health crises, power outages, fires, child abductions, and more) reach the public swiftly and efficiently, regardless of the medium.\\n“As we celebrate 20 years of CAP, I’m incredibly proud that it has become the backbone of emergency communication worldwide, recognized by the UN as the standard for the Early Warnings for All program. The success of CAP is a testament to the dedication and collaboration of so many over the years, and I extend my sincere thanks to everyone who has played a part in making it the global standard it is today,” said Elysa Jones, chair of the OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee (EMTC). “CAP’s ability to deliver consistent, interoperable alerts through multiple channels has made it indispensable for disaster management. We’ll continue to evolve CAP to ensure it serves communities in need.”\\nThe CAP community will commemorate this significant anniversary milestone at the CAP Implementation Workshop from 22-24 October in Leuven, Belgium. OASIS is a co-sponsor of the event, which will focus on the use of CAP and its consistent use throughout the world. OASIS and the EMTC will continue to work with nations and organizations to explore future advancements in global emergency alerting.\\nThe fundamental need for CAP was identified by the Partnership for Public Warning (PPW) in response to the 9/11 attacks when there was no consistent method for informing the nation.  The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami highlighted the urgent need for improved emergency alert communication across the globe. With the support of Eliot Christian, longtime CAP advocate and former chief architect of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Information System (WIS), and Elysa Jones, chair of the OASIS EMTC, along with EMTC members, CAP was officially adopted by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 2007 as ITU-T Recommendation X.1303. Since then, many international organizations like the WMO, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) have embraced CAP as an essential standard for emergency alerting. In 2021, the Call to Action on Emergency Alerting set a goal to achieve 100% CAP implementation by 2025, an initiative that has since been integrated into the UN’s Early Warnings for All initiative. \\nOASIS and its partners are committed to increasing global CAP adoption. Participation in the EM TC is open to all through membership in OASIS, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of alerting.
