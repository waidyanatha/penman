Since then, many international organizations like the WMO, the International Federation of Red Cross ... The WMO Workshop on Impact-based Forecast and Warning Services (IBFWS) will be hosted in Santiago, Chile, 09-13 December 2024. The aim of the workshop is to enhance knowledge and awareness of IBFWS within the region and reinforce CAP implementation through practical exercises. The workshop will facilitate peer-to-peer knowledge exchange and capacity building by strengthening the regional ... At the Workshops, implementers of CAP and other associated organizations discuss common issues and how to leverage the expanding adoption of CAP. Background. Today, 87% of the world\\'s population lives in a country with at least one national CAP feed operational. CAP implementation by country is shown in this zoomable map and in the static map ... The workshop focuses on integrating the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)—a standardized XML format for public alerts—into standard warning processes. Approximately 40 forecasters were trained in CAP, with an emphasis on embedding these protocols into Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure the timely and effective dissemination of ...'}], 'stop': ['\\nObservation:'], 'stream': False}'\n",
